    '''
    The Allure Adaptor for Robot Framework is a Library that can be included
    in the Robot scripts to generate Allure compatible XML files which can
    then be used to generate the Allure HTML reports.

    = Allure =
    This Library depends on the command line Allure client to perform the actual
    conversion from xml files to HTML page. For more information on the project
    Allure itself, please visit: http://allure.qatools.ru/. The Allure Command
    Line application can be downloaded from the Allure GitHub
    [https://github.com/allure-framework/allure1/releases/latest|release page]

    *NOTE: Allure 1.4.x and 1.5.x are supported. Allure 2 is currently not supported.*


    = Adaptor =

    The Adapter is split into two parts: Listener and Library. The Listener
    contains the logic for the Allure file creation. The Library assists the
    Listener by providing keywords to access the listener instance.

    *Listener*

    The Listener contains the core functionality. The listener makes use of the
    Robot Framework [http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#listener-interface|
    Listener interface] specification to capture the start and end of a suite,
    test case and keyword and output them into the Allure XML format. The files
    are generated when all the test cases and teardown keywords have been processed.

    The listener creates the following files:
    - XML file for each processed suite file.
    - allure.properties, one for each test run.
    - environment.xml, one for each test run.

    *Library*

    The Library is supplementary to the listener and serves to start the Listener
    when it wasn't specified when starting Robot Framework. The keywords that are
    part of this library interact with the active Listener instance. In the event
    that the listener was already started, only the library activation if performed.
